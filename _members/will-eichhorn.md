William earned his Bachelor of Arts in Biology with a minor in Creative Writing from UNCG in the Spring of 2024. During his time at UNCG, Will had the opportunity to work on a broad spectrum of research under the direction of several primary investigators. He started off in the Tomkiel Dean lab, researching meiosis during spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Will then spent several semesters investigating the underlying gene pathways in the resource partitioning of Arabidopsis lyrata in the Remington Lab. He then moved into the lab of Dr. Louis Marie Bobay to learn Python and its application to microbiological bioinformatics. During the summer of 2022, Will had the opportunity to intern with the Greensboro Science Center and gained experience in ecological field work, water quality maintenance, and biodiversity data collection. Outside of research, during his time at UNCG, Will spent several years tutoring for biology courses and helped to implement tutoring support for the higher-level Genetics and Cell Biology courses. After graduating, Will worked for several months in the Molecular Microbiology department of LabCorp as a Technologist Trainee.

Outside of the lab, Will enjoys creative writing, hiking, drawing, playing both tabletop games and video games, and spending all the time that he can with his partner and their two mischievous cats, Hershey and Crowley.
