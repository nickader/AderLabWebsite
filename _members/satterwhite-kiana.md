I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at UNCG on a pre-physician assistant track, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree as a Biology major with a Chemistry minor. I have always been passionate about bringing more people of color into healthcare. I have goals to work in the OBG-YN specialty, but I have also recently developed an interest in perfusion. Outside of biology, I'm passionate about fashion, gaming, watching anime, and collecting Sanrio merch.
