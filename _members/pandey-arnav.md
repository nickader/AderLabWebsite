Arnav is a first-year PhD student joining the Ader Lab in Fall 2025. He earned his BA in Liberal Arts with a concentration in Life Sciences from Soka University of America. During his time there, he investigated the effects of biochar in the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil and worked to identify novel Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the summer of 2024, Arnav worked in the Myers Lab, studying the effects of an oral galectin-3 inhibitor on vein wall fibrosis in a mouse model.
