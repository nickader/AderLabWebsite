I'm a biotechnology student at UNCG on a premed track, and my career goal has always been to become a pediatric surgeon. I've always been passionate about helping sick children and making a difference in their lives. Iâ€™m committed to pursuing this path and hope to use my scientific knowledge to help others. I also want to get involved in charitable initiatives that support access to healthcare for underprivileged communities.
