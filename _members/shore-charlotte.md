Charlotte earned her bachelor's degree in biology at UNCG while working in the Tomkiel Dean lab studying meiosis during spermatogenesis in the male fruit fly. During her time here, she investigated the role of ubiquitination in chromosome segregation and nuclear lamina maintenance during meiosis. She continued this research as a lab technician post-graduation, gaining valuable experience performing independent research, planning experiments, and mentoring undergraduate students.

Charlotte is currently a PhD student in the BBS program at Yale University.
