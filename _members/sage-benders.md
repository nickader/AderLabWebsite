I'm a current undergraduate student at UNCG entering my third year of study, pursuing a B.S in Biology with a Biotechnology concentration and a minor in African American Studies. I have aspirations to become a Medical Laboratory Scientist after graduation. Outside of academics, I enjoy volunteering, Zumba, thrifting, collecting Funko Pops, and obsessing over everything Marvel-related.
