I am a premedical postbaccalaureate student, and my passion is people—from learning languages to understand their words, to studying cells to understand their bodies! I want to become the best doctor ever: the kind you go to because you know she'll believe you and make you feel heard, respected, and safe. I am particularly interested in dementia and Alzheimer's, women's and children's health, cancer, and mental health. I am super passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion across every field, and especially in healthcare—from the people delivering care, to those receiving it. I love making friends, eating yummy food from around the world, reading, playing video games, and eating something sweet every day.
