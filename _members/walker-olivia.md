I am working towards my Bachelorâ€™s degree in human biology with a double minor in chemistry and genetic counseling. After UNCG, I plan on obtaining my PhD in molecular biology to later work as a clinical cytogeneticist! In my free time I like to be out in nature, and spend time with my family/friends.
