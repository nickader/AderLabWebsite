Charlotte earned her bachelor's degree in biology at UNCG while working in the Tomkiel Dean lab studying meiosis during spermatogenesis in the male fruit fly. During her time here, she investigated the role of ubiquitination in chromosome segregation and nuclear lamina maintenance during meiosis. She continued this research as a lab technician post-graduation, gaining valuable experience performing independent research, planning experiments, and mentoring undergraduate students.

Currently, Charlotte is working as a research technician in the Ader lab as well as preparing applications for PhD programs in cell and molecular biology.  Her research interests include protein sorting and intracellular membrane traffic, nuclear envelope structure and chromatin organization, and the cell cycle control system.

Outside of the lab, Charlotte enjoys cooking international cuisine, hiking in the mountains of NC, wildlife photography, and spending time with her 3 cats and pet rabbit.
